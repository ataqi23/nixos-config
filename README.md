# NixOS Configuration Files
These are my NixOS configuration files. As a declarative operational system, these `.nix` files almost entirely configure the packages and applications of the entire system. These files are not well written by any means, but they represent my journey with Nix!

So far, I have implemented the following:
- RStudio Development Environment
- Customized zsh shell
